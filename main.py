from hello_world import *
# This file imports everything from hello_world.py
# and does not contain any additional code.

# It serves to demonstrate the import functionality.

# When you run main.py, it will execute the code in hello_world.py
# and print the messages to the console.

# To run the script, use the command: python main.py

# Ensure that both hello_world.py and main.py are in the same directory.

# The output will be:
# Hello, World!
# This is a simple Python script.
# Goodbye, World!
